# odin-recipes
Odin recipes project...


I can't figure this out...!!
I don't see anything updating, my other html docs aren't showing and they're not accessing the links!!

I believe I see the error but still, I've already updated in nano on terminal... So why does it still not make the corrections on my git hub repos...??
